<action>
Review `.planning/agent-pass-cards/` files whose names contain `phase1`.

Rewrite `.planning/phases/02-core-reading-experience-parity/02-phase-audit.md` with this structure:
- `# Phase 2 Audit: Core Reading Experience Parity`
- `## Completed Slices` (bullet list; one line per pass card slice)
- `## Verification Signals` (bullet list of concrete gate commands marked pass)
- `## Remaining Gaps` (bullet list of explicit follow-ups, partials, or pending items)
- `## Follow-Up Work` (numbered list with concrete next actions)

Only modify the audit file.
